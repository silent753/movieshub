        <H1>   1. BAHUBALI</H1>
        <p>1. Highest Grossing Indian Movie -  Baahubali 2 (Hindi) (2017)</p>
        <p></p>   Director: SS Rajamouli </p>
            
        <p>  Cast: Prabhas, Rana Daggubati and Anushka Shetty  </p>
            
        <p> Box-office collection: Rs. 501 crore (Hindi) </p>
        
            
             
            
        <p>   With the Baahubali series, we saw the standards of visual effects in Indian cinema shoot up to a whole new level. It was a visual extravaganza that the whole nation feasted on. Baahubali 2 carried the massive expectations from the first and upped the scale on many aspects and most importantly gave an answer to the question of why did Kattappa kill Baahubali? One must give credit to SS Rajamouli not only for nailing the visual part of the film but also for making it one emotional roller coaster ride. He really takes you into his fantasy world and you begin to feel like a part of it. </p>

    <h1>2. Highest Grossing Indian Movie -  Dangal (2016)</h1>
    
    <p>Director: Nitesh Tiwari </p>
    <p>Cast: Aamir Khan, Fatima Sana Sheikh and Sanya Malhotra </p>
    <p>Box-Office Collection: Rs. 387 crore </p>
    <p>While Aamir Khan was the biggest star in the film, he decided to take a step back and let his on-screen daughters take the limelight in this one. Dangal was based on Mahavir Singh Phogat , played by Aamir Khan, and his journey of transforming his two daughters into world-class wrestlers. The film at the start explains how Mahavir Singh had to give up on his dream of winning India a gold medal due to his family responsibilities. Later, he felt that he’ll fulfill his dream through his own son by making him worthy enough himself. But, after his wife conceived a fourth daughter, his dream will never turn into a reality. Later on, he realizes that gold is a gold regardless of a girl wins it or a boy and from that moment he puts everything he’s got in making his daughters good enough to compete with the best of the world. We all are aware of the fact that how dedicated an actor Aamir is but he set a whole new benchmark with this film. While the actor could have easily put on a bodysuit to play the part in which he’s seen as an overweight old person, the actor chose to gain the weight himself so his body language and gestures seem authentic to the audience. Talking about authenticity, the lead cast of the film also underwent professional training before the film went on floors in order to move and fight like a professional wrestler. Well, their efforts surely did not go to waste as Dangal went on to be a massive success. </p>

    <h1>3. Highest Grossing Indian Movie - Sanju (2018)</h1>
    <p>Director: Rajkumar Hirani 
    
    <p> Cast: Ranbir Kapoor, Vicky Kaushal, Paresh Rawal, Anushka Sharma, Dia Mirza and Sonam Kapoor </p>
        
    <p>    Box-Office Collection: Rs. 341.22 crore </p>
    <p>Another trend that seems to have captured Bollywood are biopics. In the past few years, we’ve seen biopics being made on sports personalities, politicians, freedom fighters. But, a biopic of an actor was something new for the audience especially one which is filled with so many ups and downs. Sanju , in which Ranbir Kapoor played the role of Sanjay Dutt, never denied that actor was flawed. They showed him as a drug addict, a womanizer and a person who failed to realize the importance of family. However, in the end, life comes full circle as he realises his mistakes and tries to find redemption. The two major factors behind the  film’s success were Rajkumar Hirani’s style of storytelling and Ranbir Kapoor’s flawless performance. Along with getting his looks right, the actor managed to perfect his body language, the tone of his voice and the overall mannerisms that made the audience convinced that they were watching Sanjay Dutt on the big screen. </p>

    <h1>4. Highest Grossing Indian Movie - PK (2014)</h1>
    
    <p>Director: Rajkumar Hirani </p>
    <p>Cast: Aamir Khan, Anushka Sharma, Sanjay Dutt and Boman Iran</p>
    <p>Box-Office collection: Rs. 340.80 crore</p>
    
    <p>Another Rajkumar Hirani film and another blockbuster. There’s something about his way of storytelling that gets the audience entertained along with touching a soft spot in their hearts. In PK , we saw Aamir Khan play an alien who comes to earth but ends up losing the device he needs to go back. Stranded alone on a new planet, PK ( Aamir Khan ) begins to understand the working of our society which is obviously flawed in many ways. The film makes us realise that many rituals and customs that we consider to be ‘normal’ have no logic or reasoning behind them and we’re following them just because we’ve been told by our elders who also went through the same process. Anushka Sharma played the role of Jaggu in the film, Pk’s only friend and a journalist who helps him explain his observations to the world. </p>

    <h1>5. Highest Grossing Indian Movie - Tiger Zinda Hai (2017)</h1>
    
    <p>Director: Ali Abbas Zaffar </p>
    
    <p> Cast: Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif </p>
        
        <p> Box-Office collections: Rs. 339.16 crore</p>
    
    <p>Tiger Zinda Hai was the sequel to the Salman Khan and Katrin Kaif starrer Ek Tha Tiger. Directed by Ali Abbas Zaffar the film picks off right from where the first part ended. Tiger and Zoya have created their own little world away from the battlefield. But they’re asked to return to their duty when there’s a hostage situation when a terrorist organization named ISC takes 21 Indian nurses as a hostage. In this film, Salman Khan was back at doing what he does best - beating up the baddies in his own unique style.  Katrina Kaif too didn’t hold back much in the film as she played the role of an ISI agent convincingly. </p>

    <h1>6. Highest Grossing Indian Movie - Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015)</h1>
    
    <p>Director: Kabir Khan </p>
    <p>Cast: Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif </p>
    <p>Box-Office Collections: Rs. 320.34 crore</p>
    <p> 
    
        Bajrangi Bhaijaan stands out from possible every Salman Khan film out there. As in this one, he played a vulnerable, naive and innocent  Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi a.k.a. Bajrangi rather than the macho, larger than life ‘hero’ we’re all used to seeing. Pawan believes in always doing good for others no matter what. So, when he comes across a lost girl and finds out that she’s from Pakistan, he makes it his mission to get her back to her family. This heart touching story is filled with many light moments and it becomes particularly fun when Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who plays a local news channel reporter, gets involved in the film. </p>

    <h1>7. Highest Grossing Indian Movies -  Padmaavat (2018)</h1>
    
    <p>Director: Sanjay Leela Bhansali </p>
    <p>Cast: Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor </p>
    <p>Box-Office Collections: Rs. 305.15 crore</p>
    <p>Padmaavat was a film that faced many controversies before the film’s release, but once it hit the theatres, it set the  box-office on fire . In Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s magnum opus set in Rajasthan, we saw the story of Queen Padmavati, played by Deepika Padukone, who is married to a noble king, played by Shahid Kapoor, and they live in a prosperous empire until an ambitious Sultan, played by Ranveer Singh, hears of Padmavati's beauty and develops an obsession for her. Spread across Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Rajasthan, each frame of the movie looked like a painting. While Shahid and Deepika’s performance came in for praise, it was Ranveer who stole the show. His portrayal of the ruthless and cunning Khilji shook up everyone. Playing a negative character on screen is never easy but Ranveer completely sank his teeth into the role and came up with a spectacular performance. </p>

    <h1>8. Highest Grossing Indian Movie - Sultan (2016)</h1>
    <p>Director: Director: Ali Abbas Zafar</p>
    <p>Cast: Salman Khan and Anushka Sharma</p>
    <p>Box-Office Collection: Rs 300.16 crore</p>
    <p>In Sultan film, Salman Khan plays a 40-year-old former wrestler who has seen the highs and lows of life. Going into flashback, we are introduced to Sultan’s younger self at a time when nobody could beat him. Today, however, Sultan is just a shadow of his former self. Life has been knocking him down for years. Even though Sultan knows he’s down, he also knows he’s not out. His desire to win Aarfa’s ( Anushka Sharma ) heart also is a big motivating factor for his return. Just like Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Salman’s character in the film is not his usual larger than life one. The man you see in the ring is down to earth, humble and quite unlike your typical Bollywood superstar. He is scared of his opponents and doesn’t act invincible either. However, to the delight of Salman Khan fans, the film ticks all the boxes for a masala entertainer. Don’t go looking for a twist ending, though. We all know what to expect from such a film, but it’s still a lot of fun to see the underdog win.</p>

    <h1>9. Highest Grossing Indian Movie -  Dhoom 3 (2013)</h1>
    
    <p>Director: Vijay Krishna Acharya </p>
    <p>Cast: Aamir Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Katrina Kaif and Uday Chopra</p>
    <p>Box-Office Collections: Rs. 284.27 crore</p>
    <p>
        Dhoom 3 Aamir Khan played a double role in the film and the audience just couldn’t have more of him. This slick thriller, directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya and starring Aamir Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Katrina Kaif and Uday Chopra might not have received great reviews but went on to have a phenomenal run at the box-office . </p>

    <h1>10. Highest Grossing Indian Movie -  Kabir Singh (2019)</h1>
    <p>Director: Sandeep Reddy Vanga </p>
    <p>Cast: Shahid Kapoor and Kiara Advani </p>
    <p>Box-Office Collections: Rs. 243.37 crore*</p>
    <p> 
    
        We all have flaws in one way or another. Kabir Singh too was a story of a flawed man. Played by Shahid Kapoor , Kabir Singh is shown to be a college topper with anger management issues. He’s brilliant at almost everything that he tries his hands on but at times the anger gets the better of him. Kabir falls in love with a junior named Preeti (Kiara Advani) and makes the entire college aware of his intentions. Later on, her parents don’t approve of him and forcibly get her married to a boy of their liking. Unfortunately, Kabir just can’t seem to get over her turns into an alcoholic and drug addict trying to numb the pain of losing her. The film is referred to as the modern-day version of ‘Devdas’ with Shahid Kapoor’s performance receiving heaps of praise from critics as well as the audience. </p>
